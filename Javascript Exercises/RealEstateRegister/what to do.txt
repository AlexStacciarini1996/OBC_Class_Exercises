I must create a system of real estate registering for a real estate broker

- To register a real estate, I need the following information:
* Type (house or apartment)
*Area
*Is rent?
- After registering the asset, the form must be wiped for the next registering
-Below the form, there must be a list of the registerd assets and this list must be updated as soon as the asset is created in the form
- In this list, the rent assets must have the label "RENT" before the first information, with red background and white letters
- There must be a "remove" button if the agent decides to remove an asset from the list

To do this I will need:

-Classes:
*At least 2 classes
*There must be one class for the asset and one for the app
*One class per file
*I can create more classes if necessary
- DOM Manipulation
- Calling events from HTML
